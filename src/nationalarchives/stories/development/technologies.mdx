# Technologies

## Storybook

Most widely supported open source frontend workshop for building UI components, constantly updated, also used by TDR

## ESNext JavaScript (not TypeScript)

JavaScript over TypeScript to allow in-project compilation and possible tree-shaking without extra libraries

## Babel

De facto JavaScript compiler and transpiler, allows us to use most up-to-date JavaScript for increased efficiency and cleaner source code

## SCSS

Most mature CSS preprocessor, used in other TNA projects, huge support

## BEM

Agreed CSS methodology within TNA

## Webpack

Already used in many TNA projects, most mature offering although arguably not the fastest - we could consider changing in the future

## Nunjucks

Used by GDS and made by Mozilla, Nunjucks is simple and expandable and allows us to use components in the GOV.UK prototype kit

## npm

Used by many TNA projects and provides highly available package repository, de facto standard for JavaScript packages

## GitHub actions

Free actions not relying on external services, used on some TNA projects but will allow us to have more of a CI/CD methodology

## Prettier

Opinionated code formatter for (S)CSS, JavaScript, JSON and other file types, intended to reduce bikeshedding

## ESLint

De facto linter for JavaScript to catch potential issues

## Stylelint

Most widely supported and mature (S)CSS linter

## Jest

Lightweight and fast testing library, support for Storybook, easy learning curve

## NVM

Ensures all developers can work on the same version of NodeJS, reduces differences between development environments

## Chromatic.com
